        <dt>What did you use to make this site?</dt>
        <dd>All the coding was done by hand using SubEthaEdit on a 12" Apple Powerbook G4 [[edit: also on my Mac Pro]]. Technologies include PHP, CSS, and Javascript. Mike found it easier to develop on my Mac, mainly because Mike could program anywhere. For example, Mike's currently writing this FAQ while lounging on the grass in Central Park.</dd>
        <dt>What browsers are supported?</dt>
        <dd>All browsers should work. So far, we've tested Firefox 2.0.0.11, Firefox 1.0.6, Internet Explorer 6.0.2900.2180, Opera 8.0, Safari 2.0 (412.2)</dd>
        <dt>What gave the inspiration for <b>nysubway.info</b>?</dt>
        <dd>Two pieces, actually. The initial inspiration came from the frustration of looking at the subway map and still not really knowing the most efficient way to get there. Google Maps and MapQuest are great at plotting out driving directions, but that fails when you don't have a car. There are essentially two modes of transportation in NYC, as most here would know: subway and taxi. Obviously, taxis know where they're going (most of the time). And yes, there is a bus system too, but Mike never used it. Secondly, the idea for using Google Maps came from <a href="http://www.housingmaps.com">housingmaps.com</a>, a site that merges Google Maps with Craigslist. Then Mike realised that there was a great potential in Google Maps' ability to be used as an API. After doing some hunting for several months on a good, clean way (most tutorials and such available on the web are hacks and can be easily broken by Google's updates), Google was gracious enough to offer their own API.</dd>

            Wow.. it's been a long day and many things were fixed. I don't think I can list them all, but here goes.
            <ul>
                <li>Copyright added.</li>
                <li>Start and End addresses now use marker icon instead of number.</li>
                <li>Fixed listing of steps. There was a quirkiness of choosing which lines to take.</li>
                <li>Map link was added to the PDF map of the system.</li>
                <li>Transfer times are now factored into the algorithm.</li>
                <li>UI was cleaned up a bit (no more confusing time, transfer, waiting columns).</li>
                <li>Fixed bug where lines from potential end stations to the end location weren't being drawn correctly.</li>
                <li>Fixed some database issues.</li>

            Defect fixing release! We're still going through the database to make sure everything works right. The algorithm was tweaked to improve performance, especially on locations of long distance. Major changes have been made, so please try it out!
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed issue where certain paths could not be found</li>
                <li>Fixed output problem with times that had seconds &lt; 10</li>
                <li>Modified algorithm to improve accuracy. Also made it more flexible for finding obscure routes.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Great news!  After sacrificing a good proportion of our winter vacations, we are able to bring you a massive upgrade to our previous search algorithms.  The number of criteria being considered when searching for the optimal path has been drastically increased.  The search algorithm now considers distance traveled, time traveled, transfer time, walk distance, distance from stop in question to end point (only previous criteria), etc.</p>
<p>After completing the algorithm, copious tests were performed, and compared to our personal experience with those paths.  The tests performed were long paths (Columbia to Jamaica) and paths as short as one stop.  Our new algorithm has exceeded all expectations, and have even taught us faster routes than we ourselves knew.  We tried our best to optimize the speed at which these calculations are performed.</p>
<p>Additional, the drastic changes in our algorithm has caused the output to be significantly different.  Painstaking effort has been made such that the clean, crisp user interface has been preserved, and has been made more reliable.</p>
<p>This vacation has given ample time to plan the future of the sight.  Very exciting things are in store for us as the new year continues.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Version 3.0 released.</li>
                <li>New algorithm! Search is more accurate than ever before.</li>
            </ul>

            Back and better than ever!<br/>
            I want to post this quick since it's 01:32 and I'm tired. This site has been down and out of commission for a while, but I decided it was time to bring it back.<br/><br/>
            Some things I want to point out:
            <ul>
            <li>It now allows selection of multiple addresses. It will also find the fastest path (not the shortest), which means it <b>can</b> and does differentiate between local and express trains.</li>
            <li>There was no previous inspiration other than my deep frustration with the lack of direction finding while living in NYC.</li>
            <li>This is always a work in progress, so please, feedback is much appreciated! digression-dawt-net-at-gmail-dawt-com</li>
            <li>Yes, I know the look needs to freshen up a bit.. I wanted to bring the functionality back first.. I also have to bring <a href="http://www.bostonsubway.info">bostonsubway.info</a> back as well....</li>
            <li>I do this on my own and in my spare time. It's fun and it's challenging. And no, it doesn't take me away from my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>The database is entirely done <b><i>by hand</i></b>. That's right, folks, I looked at a subway map, measure out the distances and determined a heuristic for differentiating between local and express. The geocodes may be off a bit for the stations; if they are, please shoot me an email and let me know!</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
    		<ul>
    			<li>Fixed problems with station info when clicking on marker.</li>
    			<li>Changed "Station" search to "Address" search.</li>
    			<li>Added an address example so people know how to use the box.</li>
    			<li>Updated instruction list to use icons instead of letters.</li>
    			<li>Updated instruction list to highlight station names using bold.</li>
    			<li>Updated to Google Maps API v2</li>
    			<li>Thought about update to icon.</li>
    			<li>Made the feedback e-mail links more sane. (Boo to SPAM!)</li>
    		</ul>
    	</dd>
    	<dt class="date">2007 October 29</dt>
    	<dd>
    		<ul>
    			<li>Revitalized the project after letting it go stale.</li>
    			<li>Brought the new algorithm online.</li>

    			<li>Fixed some geocoding issues.</li>
    			<li>Changed the default zoom</li>
    			<li>Search no longer relies on Geocoder.us</li>
    			<li>Fixed/Optimized multiple locations found dialog.</li>

            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt class="date">2005 August 2</dt>

        <dt class="date">2005 August 1</dt>
        <dd>Debut for nysubway.info! A few kinks that need to be worked out, but for the most part, it works as planned.</dd>
        <dt class="date">2005 July 26</dt>
        <dd>Display works; however, showing all stations is slow.</dd>
        <dt class="date">2005 July 23</dt>
        <dd>Idea conceived to superimpose the New York City Subway system onto a map. Also include a direction finder. Development begins.</dd>
