Our Engagement Story!<br/>
07 June 2008

<p><strong>Mike:</strong><br/>
It's one of those moments that you look for eagerly in anticipation. And when it comes, it's like a whirlwind of fun and excitement. Having someone so special in life is a huge blessing from God. I knew she was the one and that I wanted to do something special for her. I loved everything about her and we were developing a true understanding for each other.</p>

<p><strong>Jess:</strong><br/>
<img class="story1" src="/images/p.jpg"/>I have been waiting for Mike to propose to me since we finished our pre-engagement counseling!! Though we went through some rough times together, I finally was at a point where I could see God's blessings on our relationship. I was fully convicted that Mike was the one whom I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. :)</p>

<p><strong>Mike:</strong><br/>
I remember Jess talking once that she would love for Tiff and Aya (both in Southern California) to be there for our engagement, but the trickiest part was convincing Jess to go to LA without giving it away. Even though we weren't sure, my friends booked tickets anyway to fly out to California and help me out.</p>

<p><strong>Jess:</strong><br/>
Meanwhile, I was still eagerly waiting... and traveling back and forth to different places because of work and Tiff's wedding planning in LA. The week before the engagement I was stressed because I was in Arizona for my business trip, but Tiff had requested for me to fly straight to LA to help her out! I was tired but I wanted to make sure that my best friend was ready for her big day! (plus she greeted me with some yummy yogurt :P)</p>

<p><strong>Mike:</strong><br/> 
The week before was a mad rush to figure things out. I told her best friend Tiffany to use her wedding planning as an excuse that she needed her. Success! In the meantime, Reggie and I were madly looking for places to set up a treasure hunt. I wanted to do something a little more special than just get down on my knees and propose to her. We knew nothing about LA, so we used Google Maps to zoom into Cypress, Westminster, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, looking for places that were good. I knew that Jess' favorite mall was South Coast Plaza, but I didn't know what stores were there. Coincidentally, the day before the proposal I called Jess while they were shopping at Barney's New York in South Coast Plaza, so I made that my first location!</p>

<p><img class="story2" src="/images/p.jpg"/> I had three friends with me: Reggie from Michigan, Victor from New York, and Philip from the Bay Area. I am truly grateful to all of them for willing to come out and helping me on this special day. After I picked up Reggie and Victor on Friday night, we packed and went straight to bed. At 3:45am the next morning, we began our trek down to LA. When we arrived LA at 10:30am, I gave Randy (Tiff's now-husband) a call to meet up with him. I wanted to give him the first clue to the hunt, so I was trying hard to crank out the poem to be given to her.</p>

<p><strong>Jess:</strong><br/>
While Mike and his poor friends were driving down to LA, Tiff and I woke up leisurely, got pretty in our dresses and met Randy up for lunch. (laugh) Randy and Tiff were tricky tricky! I remember waiting with Tiff at the restaurant for Randy and I was saying... "Where IS Randy?" and Tiff said "He was running some errands" and we started eating first. Little did I know, ha!</p>

<p><strong>Mike:</strong><br/>
After that, we quickly drove to Wal-Mart to get what I needed for the proposal. Tiki torches to make it look like a special event; Poster board and post to make a sign (Jason gave me a good idea... sort of. He wanted me to bury the ring, but I decided that I wanted to bury a rock instead that said "I love you. Will you marry me?" and needed a sign for it).</p>

<p><strong>Jess:</strong><br/>
<img class="story3" src="/images/p.jpg"/>After lunch, I went with the couple to their wedding planning meeting, and then Randy had to leave again. After Tiff and I were alone, she told me she has something for me and handed me a piece of paper. I grinned from ear to ear. OF COURSE I KNEW WHAT MIKE WAS UP TO RIGHT AWAY! I knew him quite well :). But... being girls we wanted to get our nails done first (yeah you are reading right, haha). Tiff wanted to get her toes did, and I figured I wanted to wear my ring proudly with nicely manicured fingernails! This all worked out nicely because I found out after the engagement that Mike was asking Tiff to stall for time while they were trying to find a nice proposal place... so what better way to stall than getting your nails done?</p>

<p><strong>Mike:</strong><br/>
Then, it was time to find out more about SoCal beaches. I still hadn't found the place yet where I wanted to propose to Jess. What I was thinking of was a nice cove, somewhere that would be beautiful and private where I can surprise Jess. We drove around until we decided on Crystal Cove. There we found the perfect spot: a scenic point overlooking the ocean led from a nice, quite boardwalk. It was absolutely breathtaking. The view out to the ocean is wonderfully spectacular! We set up the place by tying all the tiki torches to the posts. I laid down the blanket that I used when I had asked her out two years ago. I wrote on the sign and Philip drew the treasure box. We mounted it to the post with duct tape and I put it into the ground. Victor had found a flat rock and casually threw it onto the ground. It broke neatly in half laterally, which made for a very cool surprise. I wrote inside the rock and placed it on the ground in front of the sign.</p>

<p><strong>Jess:</strong><br/>
Let the excitement begin! First, I read the poem that Mike wrote, which spoke of our relationship and the support that we received from our great friends.<img class="story4" src="/images/p.jpg"/> My eyes swelled with tears. Then, the first clue was EASY... and we headed straight to South Coast for Barney's NY. There, I ran into my dear friend, Aya, and her boyfriend Daniel, who started filming the whole thing! Aya gave me another clue; this time, I was much more challenged. I started talking things out to myself and though I wasn't sure what the second destination was, I was already certain that the proposal place was going to be at Crystal Cove! Luckily, I didn't give up on the treasure hunt, because Mike's purpose of the hunt was to pick up friends that we have met along our life's journey. So after some mad text messaging among the involved parties, I was allowed some help and went to Fashion Island as the second destination.</p>

<p><strong>Mike:</strong><br/>
At Fashion Island, Randy and Reggie hung out on the mezzanine while waiting for Jess and the crew to arrive. Once Aya called saying they were in the parking lot, Randy headed down to Urban Outfitters to greet the crowd.</p>

<p><strong>Jess:</strong><br/>
The crew and I dashed for Urban Outfitters right away upon arrival. Then I bumped into Randy there and he was checking out Transformer's shirts. I said, "Oh, you... you are not the person I am looking for! Where's Reggie/Jason?" (I figured I would be expecting at least one of those two, knowing Mike's friendships.) And sure enough, I turned around and saw Reggie! He gave me the last clue... and I was right all along!!! Crystal Cove! My favorite beach!!!</p>

<p><strong>Mike:</strong><br/>
Randy and Reggie got into Randy's car and raced away ahead of everyone else to greet them at the entrance to the boardwalk. Victor awaited their arrival and was given the notice to get things ready once Reggie got back to the parking lot. Once everyone else arrived, Reggie directed Jess to follow the boardwalk to the end. There she would find the answer she had been waiting all day to hear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Victor, Philip and I hid in the bushes. Victor and Philip were the cameramen. I hid for the surprise. We waited for Jess to walk up the boardwalk and when she did, we jumped out. Remember that I haven't seen her since we drove down to LA. She looked fabulous and very beautiful as she walked down the boardwalk. I was grinning from ear to ear! They started shooting pictures, as I waited for her to pick up the rock.</p>

<p><strong>Jess:</strong><br/>
So I had to walk silently down (oh, it was so unbearably exciting!) the boardwalk while the gang followed me. It was hilarious because as I was stretching my neck to see what's ahead of me, the tourists there were poking their heads into the proposal site. Then, all of a sudden I saw a tall man jumped out of a bush screaming, "Excuse me! We are going to have a proposal here!" and jumped back in. I was cracking up but I couldn't tell who it was! Anyway, I continued walking and Reggie directed for the audience to stop and for me to walk up by myself. Oh the intensity. I saw the cute tiki torches and my heart jumped with joy. Then, I froze. I have not an idea what next to do. I mean, there was nothing else except for a darn sign that said "Treasured Buried Here" with a darn rock underneath. I was scared for a second because I thought to myself "Oh no! Someone stole the ring with the box!"</p>

<p><strong>Mike:</strong><br/>
Not knowing what she was thinking, I jumped out of the bush and whispered, "Hunnie! You're supposed to pick up the rock!" So she picked up half on the rock - the part that says "Marry me?"</p>

<p><strong>Jess:</strong><br/>
Haha, I didn't even see the other half that says, "I love you!" until after the whole thing! The next thing I know, Mike got down on his knees and he read another poem that he wrote for me. Oh, I really didn't know what he was saying... I was just waiting for him to stop so I can say my "Of Course!"!!!</p>

<p>Mike was so sweet and made a reservation for all of us to celebrate in Honda-Ya!! Yummy Japanese restaurant :) We all had an amazing time and Mike and I appreciated all the wonderful friends that shared the special day with us!</p>
